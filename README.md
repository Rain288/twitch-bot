# twitch_bot
A very simple twitch bot I made for a friend's stream using tmi.js .

## How to use
* Clone the repo and then `node app.js`
* External modules used that should be installed with NPM are `request` and `tmi.js`
* Customize `example_config.js` and when you're done rename it to `config.js`
And that's about it
